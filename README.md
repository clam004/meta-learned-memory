documentation and tutorial on adding the capability of storing neural memory to a neural chatbot
This repository builds on the [chat-transformer](https://github.com/clam004/chat-transformer) chatbot
by adding a memory mechinism to the [transformer sequence to sequence model](https://github.com/clam004/chat-transformer)
based on this [paper by Tsendsuren Munkhdalai et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.09720.pdf) called 
[Metalearned Neural Memory: Teaching neural networks how to remember](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/metalearned-neural-memory-teaching-neural-networks-how-to-remember/)
