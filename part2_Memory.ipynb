    "## Perceptron Learning Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "The perceptron learning rule is used to do fast gradient free updates to the neural memory network. This perceptron learning rule is explained well here: http://hagan.okstate.edu/4_Perceptron.pdf \n",
    "\n",
    "The perceptron learning rule allows you to change the weights of a linear transformation matrix in such a way as to nudge it's output closer to or away from a desired target or vector of targets, without having to calculate a mean squared error, and perform backpropagation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the some layer of a feed forward neural network, activations \"a\" = relu(Wx+b).\n",
    "\n",
    "\"a\" might have several dimensions, but the first dimension of \"a\" is only dependant on x and the first row of W. So if you consider W to be a single row and \"a\" to be a single activation, then without loss of generality, what applies for this row applies to the entire matrix W and the entire vector a. \n",
    "\n",
    "if `W = [-1, 1]` and `b = [-1]`, you can see by plotting `W[x_1, x_2] + b = 0` on a horizontal `x_1` by vertical `x_2` axis that this is a line with slope `1` that intersects the `x_1` axis at `-1`. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = 'files/grapher1.gif' width=400 height =400>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the decision boundary because at this boundary `Wx+b=0` and on either side of the boundary you are either positive or negative.  The point `p1 = x_1, x_2 = 2, 1` would be evaluated as `-2` if you plugged it into `Wx+b` and so would be zero after an activation function `f(a) = max(0,a)`. You can tell which side of the line above is the negative and positive regime by seeing which direction the vector `[-1, 1]` points. Moving `-1` along `x_1` means one step to the left, and `1` step upwards along `x_2` draws an arrow that point up and to the left. So it seems the point `[2,1]` is on the wrong side of this line if you want it to be positive. That direction that vector `W` points in, is the direction towards the side of the decision boundary that is positive in `Wx`. The opposite side of the boundary is negative in `Wx`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose without calculating the gradient you want to change `W` such that the point `p1 = x_1, x_2 = 2, 1` will be classified as positive. if you add `p1` to `W` you get `W = [1, 2]`, and if you add the error to the bias, ie `error = target - activation = 1 - 0 = 1`, you get `error + b_old = -1 + 1 = b_new = 0`\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = 'files/grapher2.gif' width=400 height =400>\n",
    "\n",
    "The new line points up and to the right and will now classify p1 correctly. `Wx + b = 2+2+1 = 5`. Notice that b also changes in the correct direction, if you didnt change b, the resulting decision boundary `[1, 2]x - 1 = 0` would have been a negatively sloped line that intersects the `x_1` axis at `x_1 = 1`, whereas now that `b = 1`, the intersect is at `0`. This update has not only rotated the vector `W` to point towards `p1` but shifted the decision boundary downwards pulling the boundary away from `p1` so that `p1` is farther within the region of positivity and therefore more positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The perceptron learning rule formula is as follows:\n",

    "$$ b_t = b_{t-1} + (target - activation) $$\n",

    "`t` is the update iteration timestep. The circle with an x inside is the outer product, this fits with the shape of W since if the activation is m-dimensional, and input is n-dimensional, the W is shape mxn and the bias is shape mx1. Therefore the the update to W must be the same shape as W which is the shape you would get if you performed an outer product between (target - activation) x (input^T) = (update) which has shape (mx1)(1xn) = (mxn)\n",
    "\n",
    " In our example (target - activation) x (input^T) = (1 - 0) x `[[2],[1]]^T` = `[2,1]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For us the target vector is not some kind of supervised label, instead it is a target that the `backward feedback prediction functions (BFPF)` learns to come up with in order to update all the layers of the `neural memory network` (NMN) in such a way as to bind the many to many mappings of key value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our memory is stored in a multi-layer feed forward NMN\n",
